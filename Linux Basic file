ls [option(s)] [file(s)]

    If you run ls without any additional parameters, the program will list the contents of the current directory in short form.

    -l

        detailed list
    -a

        displays hidden files

cp [option(s)] sourcefile targetfile

    Copies sourcefile to targetfile.

    -i

        Waits for confirmation, if necessary, before an existing targetfile is overwritten
    -r

        Copies recursively (includes subdirectories)

mv [option(s)] sourcefile targetfile

    Copies sourcefile to targetfile then deletes the original sourcefile.

    -b

        Creates a backup copy of the sourcefile before moving
    -i

        Waits for confirmation, if necessary, before an existing targetfile is overwritten

rm [option(s)] file(s)

    Removes the specified files from the file system. Directories are not removed by rm unless the option -r is used.

    -r

        Deletes any existing subdirectories
    -i

        Waits for confirmation before deleting each file.

ln [option(s)] sourcefile targetfile

    Creates an internal link from the sourcefile to the targetfile, under a different name. Normally, such a link points directly to the sourcefile on one and the same file system. However, if ln is executed with the -s option, it creates a symbolic link that only points to the directory where the sourcefile is located, thus enabling linking across file systems.

    -s

        Creates a symbolic link

cd [options(s)] [directory]

    Changes the current directory. cd without any parameters changes to the user's home directory.
mkdir [option(s)] directoryname

    Creates a new directory.
rmdir [option(s)] directoryname

    Deletes the specified directory, provided it is already empty.
chown [option(s)] username.group file(s)

    Transfers the ownership of a file to the user with the specified user name.

    -R

        Changes files and directories in all subdirectories.

chgrp [option(s)] groupname file(s)

    Transfers the group ownership of a given file to the group with the specified group name. The file owner can only change group ownership if a member of both the existing and the new group.
chmod [options] mode file(s)

    Changes the access permissions.

    The mode parameter has three parts: group, access, and access type. group accepts the following characters:

    u

        user
    g

        group
    o

        others

    For access, access is granted by the + symbol and denied by the - symbol.

    The access type is controlled by the following options:

    r

        read
    w

        write
    x

        eXecute — executing files or changing to the directory.
    s

        Set uid bit — the application or program is started as if it were started by the owner of the file.
